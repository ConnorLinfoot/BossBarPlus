**2.0.0** *(Mar 9 2016)*
- Added support for [ViaVersion](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/viaversion.19254/) - The 1.9 protocol hack.
- Updated to use packets instead of the Bukkit API. This will allow me to easily add multiple boss bar support *very* soon!

**1.1.0** *(Mar 2 2016)*
- Added sound to the config file!
- You can now have a boss bar announcer!
- Added -p arg to the broadcast command.
- Added "smooth" option, uses ticks for processing instead of seconds. (All config options are still seconds!)
- Made the "BossBarAPI" API more friendly for other plugins. (I recommend not yet using it!)

**1.0.0** *(Mar 1 2016)*
- Initial release!
